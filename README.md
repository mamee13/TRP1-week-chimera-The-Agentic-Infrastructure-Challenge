# Project Chimera: Agentic Infrastructure Challenge

## Vision
To deliver a repository designed for autonomous agents to safely build a premium AI influencer network. Project Chimera prioritizes **Spec-Driven Infrastructure**, **Agent Governance**, and **Engineering Clarity**.

## Philosophy: Spec-First
This repository follows a strict "Specs as Source of Truth" rule. 
1. **Never generate or accept code without validated specs.**
2. **Interfaces over logic.**
3. **Clarity, traceability, and governance are paramount.**

## Project Structure
- `specs/`: Core project specifications and agent contracts.
- `research/`: Architectural intent and industry research consolidation.
- `skills/`: Definitions for specialized agent capabilities.
- `tests/`: Contract-based failing tests (defining the goalposts).
- `src/`: Intentionally minimal application logic.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ 
- `uv` (Fast Python package manager)
